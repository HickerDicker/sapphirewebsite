                <summary>Does SapphireOS support X?</summary>
                <p>SapphireOS removes components and disables many services, so not everything may be supported by default. If something does not work, try enabling default services to see if a service issue is causing the problem. If it still doesn’t work, it may simply be unsupported.</p>

                <summary>Why SapphireOS?</summary>
                <p>SapphireOS is mostly open source, though I stopped sharing my NTlite XMLs a while ago because I keep updating them. Personally, I would describe it as “source available” rather than fully open source.</p>

                <summary>Why isn’t my X driver working on Windows Server?</summary>
                <p>Windows Server 2022 is neither Windows 10 nor Windows 11 (it's version 20348), which means many drivers particularly AMD and some Intel NICs aren’t compatible. This limitation is due to the driver developers, not SapphireOS, so please keep that in mind if you’re running Server and encounter network or driver issues. :></p>

                <summary>What is the difference between Superlite and Ultralite?</summary>
                <p>This is our most frequently asked question! The main difference is that Ultralite has even more components removed than Superlite, catering to users who want a lighter ISO and are less concerned about compatibility. Performance differences are minimal, though Ultralite may boot slightly faster as it loads fewer files. Both versions include the same system tweaks.</p>
